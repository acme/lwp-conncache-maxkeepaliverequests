NAME
    LWP::ConnCache::MaxKeepAliveRequests - A connection cache that enforces
    a max keep alive limit

SYNOPSIS
      use LWP;
      use LWP::ConnCache::MaxKeepAliveRequests;
      my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
      $ua->conn_cache(
          LWP::ConnCache::MaxKeepAliveRequests->new(
              total_capacity          => 10,
              max_keep_alive_requests => 100,
          )
      );

DESCRIPTION
    LWP::UserAgent is the default module for issuing HTTP requests from
    Perl. It has a keep_alive setting which by default allows unlimited
    requests to the same server. Some servers will disconnect you after a
    limited number of requests (in Apache 2 this is achieved with the
    MaxKeepAliveRequests directive). This module allows you to limit the
    maximum number of keep alive requests to a server.
